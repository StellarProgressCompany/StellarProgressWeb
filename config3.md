To install PHP, Composer, Node.js, and npm on a Debian system, follow these steps:

### 1. Update Your System
First, update your package index to ensure you have the latest information on the newest versions of packages and their dependencies:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade -y
```

### 2. Install PHP
Debian's repositories might not always have the latest PHP version. You can add the repository maintained by the PHP team.

#### Adding the PHP repository
```bash
sudo apt install -y lsb-release apt-transport-https ca-certificates
sudo wget -qO /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/php.gpg https://packages.sury.org/php/apt.gpg
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb https://packages.sury.org/php/ $(lsb_release -sc) main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/php.list'
sudo apt update
```

#### Installing PHP
Install PHP and common extensions:
```bash
sudo apt install -y php php-cli php-fpm php-mysql php-zip php-gd php-mbstring php-curl php-xml php-pear php-bcmath
```

### 3. Install Composer
Composer is a dependency manager for PHP. Download and install it using the following commands:

```bash
curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
sudo mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer
```

### 4. Install Node.js and npm
To get the latest Node.js and npm, you can use the NodeSource repository.

#### Adding the NodeSource repository
```bash
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_lts.x | sudo -E bash -
```

#### Installing Node.js and npm
```bash
sudo apt install -y nodejs
```

### Verification
To verify that the installation was successful, you can check the versions of PHP, Composer, Node.js, and npm:

```bash
php -v
composer --version
node -v
npm -v
```

This should display the versions of the installed software, confirming successful installation.
