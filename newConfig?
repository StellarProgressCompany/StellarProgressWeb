### Guide to Creating a Laravel Project

#### Prerequisites

Before starting your first Laravel project, ensure that your local machine has PHP and Composer installed. If you're developing on macOS or Windows, you can install PHP, Composer, Node, and NPM quickly via [Laravel Herd](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/herd).

#### Step 1: System Update and Upgrade

First, update and upgrade your system to ensure you have the latest packages:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

#### Step 2: Install PHP, Composer, Node, and NPM

Use the following command to install PHP, Composer, Node, and NPM:

```bash
sudo apt install php composer nodejs npm -y
```

#### Step 3: Install Laravel Installer

Install the Laravel installer globally via Composer. This tool allows you to select your preferred testing framework, database, and starter kit when creating new applications:

```bash
composer global require laravel/installer
```

#### Step 4: Create a New Laravel Project

Create a new Laravel project using the Laravel installer:

```bash
laravel new example-app
```

#### Step 5: Start Laravel's Local Development Server

Navigate to your project directory and start the local development server using Laravel Artisan's serve command:

```bash
cd example-app
php artisan serve
```

#### Step 6: Access Your Application

Once the Artisan development server is running, your application will be accessible in your web browser at:

[http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

#### Next Steps

You're now ready to start exploring the Laravel ecosystem. You may want to configure a database to begin developing your application further. Enjoy your Laravel journey!
